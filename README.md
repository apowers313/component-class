The class for building components for [simple-component-manager](https://github.com/apowers313/simple-component-manager).

## Install

``` bash
npm install component-class
```

## Overview
This is the base class for Components to be used by Simple Component Manager. It includes the ability to define dependencies on other components (guaranteeing that they exist and are initialized first) as well as defining features on the Component that can be used to configure, set parameters, or otherwise manipulate the component.

Documentation can be found here (coming soon).

## Example
See the template directory for an example.
